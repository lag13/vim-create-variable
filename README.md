Create Variable
===============

Some time ago I was watching [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIOOLZJb87U) about the switch plugin.
At 6:47 he used a visual mapping which extracted the visual selection into a
variable, stored that visual selection into a variable above the current line,
and replaced the visual selection with the new variable. I thought it was so
nifty that I decided to make this small plugin.
